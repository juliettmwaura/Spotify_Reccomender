# Spotify_Reccomender

Spotify the app uses a system where it gets to recommend music, artists and playlist. Theserecommendation systems integrate different techniques. some of these techniques include content based which means if you like a song, it will reccomend more songs like the liked one, there is popularity technique which recommed songs that are common or mostly listened to. thereisalso another technique called collaborative filtering which means if person A like song a,b,c,d,e and person B likes song a,d,e person B is likely to be reccomeneded song b and c as it appears they ay have similar taste. In this project we will be using cosine simiarity so as to recommend songs that have a smaller cosine similarity thus the same type of music.
2. Im also working on integrating the system to incorporate collaborative filtering to reccommend artists using alternative least squares. in this we will choose a single user and multiply their vector which the vectors of all artists, then we recommend n artists with the highest scores who are new to the user
